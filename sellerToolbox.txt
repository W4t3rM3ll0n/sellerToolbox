Abstract. An open-source online social inventory system that will allow online retailers to manage their inventory, find suppliers for products,
share information about products, get analytics/data for a competitive market and keep track of tasks to do. The concept of an inventory system is
nothing new. The inventory system that is built for the Seller Toolbox will be very similar to the many inventory systems available out in the market.
The main keyword to take away from this to make this application unique is 'social'. The Seller Toolbox will be offered for free for any user and will 
generate profits through advertisment. Using the same concept for social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and more. It will be a place
where people conduct business and track their inventory. At the same time the main takeaway will be the fact that each user will act as a user does in
a social platform such as Facebook. The members of the community will be able to add each others in a friends list, share information about products, 
and do tasks that is related to social media sites. The inventory system will be the core and incentive for people to use this social platform, in the
beginning.
